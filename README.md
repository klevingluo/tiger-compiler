CS 4410 project: Tiger MIPS compiler

## running: 
- run ml-lex tiger.lex to generate the lex files
- run sml test.sml to load all of the files necessary to parse a file
- type Parse.parse("path-to-file") to get the result of parsing a single file

## TODO
- finish adding support for identifiers and strings (and maybe other stuff,
  check the tokens.sig file for a full list of tokens)
